# Computer Vision Assignment

This repo is my official one for the assignments of the course of Computer Vision offered by the University of Trento, year 2020/2021.

## First Assignment

The first assignment was just a theoretical report, a case study on some technologies that actually changed some sports. I chose basketball and the file is `Report_FirstAssignment.pdf`

## Second Assignment

The second assignment is the practical one. The input is a brief video of the Aquila Basket playing a match, through a fixed camera (1422x1080) which covers the whole field. The desired output is some computation and statistics on the teams.

This `README.md` includes a guide to set up the environment, but the description of the complete pipeline is found in the second report `Report_SecondAssignment.pdf`
